### Introduction

List of android free apps which I use regularly to keep up with my productivity expectations. These apps help me remind, track and restrict my distraction and regular doom scrolling issue.  

### 1) [Stay free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burockgames.timeclocker&hl=en_US)

We often feel upset about wasting time on phone, In my case after work I feel to use my phone for a bit ( 10 min max ) but I sit on it for almost an hour!. Which is frustrating and costs my productivity.  I wanted an App which could remind me every 10/15 min in a particular app on my phone Let's say YouTube / Instagram so that I can save some time. As soon as I open an App it wants me to set a time limit ( we can set no limit ). BONUS - It will not let me watch Reels and other vertical format videos which is a BLESSING!!

### 2) [Structured](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.unorderly.structured&hl=en_US)

This app helps me organize my daily schedule, I do not have regular activities such as Gym etc! but I do add activities like lawn mowing, groceries shopping which are regular but I kinda postponed them to the next day because I either forget it or recalled it late in the evening. 

### 3) [Digital well-being](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_US)

This is a must have app for everyone, Most android phones already have this pre-installed. Go to settings and search  *"digital wellbeing"*  it keep a track of a user screen time and we can set limit on each individual app for a certain amount. Once that allowed time frame is passed, it would gray out the app stopping us from using it more. 

### 4) [Google Task](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=en_US)
Last but not least, Coming from the offical Google company which integrated well with docs, calender, remiander etc. I use this app to primarily list out task which are odd and not much regular and do not involve in day to day activities, I regularly check them in free time when I feel do I have anything to do?

For an example. imagine a task "Search about a Good TV" or  "Need to update Raspberry pi" such task does't involve any deadlines or will not effect my day to day life.
