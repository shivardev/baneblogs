## Introduction 

You are here to learn about my setup. I have divided everything into sections with detailed information. This content is subject to change, and I have listed all the hardware and software I use — from my PC to my camera, including my Raspberry Pi.

## Gaming Setup

I have a decent yet powerful gaming PC, and here are the specifications:

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5-13600K @ 4.65GHz
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10GB OC ASUS Strix Gaming
- **RAM**: 32GB DDR4 3200MHz
- **Storage**: A bit complicated:
  - Windows Drive: SSD 256GB  
    - This is the main storage for the Windows operating system and has been in use for almost 6 years. This was the first SSD I bought when I built my first PC (spoiler alert — I later converted that system into my streaming PC).
  - Drive 2: SSD 256GB  
  - Drive 3: HDD 1TB  
  - Drive 4: SSD 2TB (for games)
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro  
  - Purchased for around $5 from G2A, and it is still working fine.
- **Power Supply**: 1000W power supply  
  - I do not know much about it, but it has been reliable.
- **Monitor**: GTEK 1080p 24-inch, 165Hz IPS  
  - Nothing fancy — I got it for $90.
- **Keyboard**: Ant Esports 60% wired mechanical keyboard. Purchased in 2021.
- **Mouse**: An affordable wireless gaming mouse. No complaints so far.
- **Headphones**: Redgear Thunder-B 7.1. Purchased in 2020.

## Streaming Setup

This was actually my first PC, which I bought in 2018. After upgrading to my current gaming PC, I decided to convert this system into a dedicated streaming PC and home server.

Here are the streaming PC specifications:

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-8700K @ 4.0GHz
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 8GB OC Gigabyte
- **RAM**: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz
- **Storage**: SSD 512GB (received for free from Micro Center)
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro
- **Power Supply**: 650W power supply

### Audio

- **Wireless Microphone**: Hollyland Lark C1
- **Streaming Microphone**: Fifine AM8T XLR / USB Microphone

    - #### Software
        - **AudioReplay**: For transmitting audio from the streaming PC to the gaming PC.  
        - **Voicemeeter Banana**: For routing audio from the gaming PC to the streaming PC.

### Video 

- Elgato HD60S  
- 4K capture card (not Elgato, another brand that cost $30)  
- Canon EOS M50 Mark II with Sigma 16mm f/1.4 lens  

    - #### Software
        - **OBS**: For streaming and recording.  
        - **Snap Camera**: For Snapchat face filters.  
        - **Streamer.bot**: To control and automate OBS actions and commands.

### Honorable Mention

- **Keyboards**
  - **Seenda Low Profile Mechanical Keyboard**: Wireless multi-connect (Wi-Fi, 2 Bluetooth) low-profile mechanical keyboard.  
  {{<image url="https://i.ibb.co/4bsQfSV/sweenda-Keyboard.jpg" >}}
  - **Ant Esports MK1200**: Wired mechanical keyboard with blue switches. My first mechanical keyboard.  
  {{<image url="https://i.ibb.co/FbMYML5j/1000302280-600x600.jpg" >}}
  {{<image url="https://i.ibb.co/xtsm0pCd/5186-MP85x-L-SY250.jpg" >}} 
  - **JamesDonkey J2**: By far my favorite mechanical keyboard. Quiet, smooth typing experience, and great for long typing sessions.

- **Key Light**: Lighting is important for streaming. Since professional key lights are expensive, I bought a simple bulb holder and covered it with a white diffuser from a local store. It works perfectly.
- **Standing Desk**: Works great for me. It feels refreshing to stand while coding.
- **Gaming Chair**: A standard gaming chair that cost around $50.
- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2**  
  - This small device works great for all my server needs without any issues. It runs Caddy, several Go services, and a few Node.js and Python services.
- **Chromebook**: An old HP Chromebook that was essentially electronic waste. It was originally a touchscreen device but has a crack on the screen. It still works fine for basic use. I mainly use it for SSH access to my Raspberry Pi.
- **RedMagic 10 Pro**  
  - A great gaming smartphone. I absolutely love it.
- **Docker**:
  - I use Docker to run all my server containers:
    - Immich  
    - Hugo blogs  
    - Jellyfin  
    - File Browser  
    - SRT server  
    - RTMP server  

## Conclusion

There you have it — that sums up my setup tour. I built this entire setup piece by piece, taking small steps over time. I carried around 70% of my equipment from India when moving to the United States in two 23kg bags. This included my streaming PC, keyboard, mouse, camera, and even my mouse pad. Yes, I am still using the same XXL mouse pad that I bought in 2019.

I truly love my setup. It is where I spend most of my time.
