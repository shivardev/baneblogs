### Things to keep before we proceed

- Sevis portal ‚Äì login info
- University IIC portal login information
- An offer letter ‚Äì what are you doing here if you don‚Äôt have one?

> The joining date mentioned in the offer letter is crucial. For instance, if your joining date is October 1st, you have a window of 10 days after the joining date to update the SEVIS portal, until October 10th. If you miss this deadline, there‚Äôs no need to worry. Our university will take care of the SEVIS update process.

### Keep note of this information

    Job Role
    Company name
    Company Address
    EIN

In case you don‚Äôt have the EIN number it‚Äôs alright as it‚Äôs not mandatory to submit. Yet it is better to contact the HR department of the company so that they will give me all the information regarding the EIN.
