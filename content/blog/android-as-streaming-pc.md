### Introduction

I found a possbible way to use my Android smartphone as a streaming PC. Many people use their Primary PC as a gaming PC. If its powerful enough to run a game also stream to Youtube or Twitch Its awesome, but we all know all PC's are not as powerful for gaming and streaming at the same time. 

If you are a gamer and a want to stream or already a streamer, Just thinking to get a PC for streaming alone but you don't to, atleast for now. 

We can use our Android/Iphone as a streaming PC. 

- Modern phones are 100% capable to stream using H264 / H265 / HVEC codecs.
- You already have a Phone give it a try. 
- Complete free and open source software apps avaible for Phones to stream. 

### Hardware requirements

- Modern Android phone 
  Too old phones can't pull this off., 

- capture card
    
    The only reasong to use a capture card it to get the best quality of the video from Gaming PC to smart phone.

    With out a capture card we have to you a network based video feed transfer which will have extra load on Gaming PC as well as the Smart Phone causing lags and framedrops.

    which looses the purpose of using a smartphone as a streaming PC.
    cheap USB capture cards are available for a few dollars / rupees anything would work.

- HDMI cable
