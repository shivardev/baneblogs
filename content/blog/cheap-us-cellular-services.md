### Introduction

In today's digital age, finding a reliable and affordable cellular network provider is easier than ever. With the proliferation of budget-friendly options offering unlimited calling and texting, staying connected has become more accessible to everyone. In this comprehensive guide, I'll delve into my personal experiences with various cheap cellular network providers, sharing insights and recommendations to help you make an informed choice.

### Why do you need a cheap network?

1.  #### You don't need an unlimited plan

In many cases, having an unlimited plan might seem like the default choice, but it's not always necessary. Consider this: you may already have access to Wi-Fi at home, work, and other frequented locations. With reliable Wi-Fi coverage, you might find yourself using cellular data sparingly throughout the day. Paying extra for an unlimited plan when you're predominantly connected to Wi-Fi could be an unnecessary expense.

2.  #### You just need an secondary phone number

Times when you already have a primary main number but still want a secondary number for Work / Job Application / ETC. Where you have to share you number to multiple people and the chances of getting spam calls are high‚¨Ü.

3.  #### you are just CHEAPüòÖ

sorry about that. but come on cheap is great!.

### List of cellular provider with cheap plans - VOIP / Physical SIM

The providers listed below offer budget-friendly plans starting from $5, providing unlimited talk and text with various minimum data options. These plans are sufficient for individuals whose primary communication needs revolve around calls and texts. However, it's important to note that these providers predominantly operate as T-Mobile MVNOs, meaning they utilize T-Mobile's network infrastructure for their services. Therefore, if you reside in an area with strong T-Mobile coverage, you're unlikely to encounter network-related issues.

Check your phone network capabilites before proceeding. These providers work best with a proper T-Mobilenetwork available area.

1.  #### Hello Mobile -- SIM Review

{{< image url="https://cache.bestmvno.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hello-Mobile-Logo.png" >}}

For some reason calling to an other country the person receiving the call will not be getting the call from US number instead a local number respective to that nation the number is generated. bit weird.

example

we calling from USA to India. people in india will not be receiving a call from the US number instead a local Indian number will be assigned and displayed.

\+1 660-0000-000 calling to INDIA a temporary number will be assigned +91 9090909090. A thing to keep in mind.

More over, in an instance where u want to upgrade your plan there is no way to do it right away. we have to wait until the running plan is expired them the new plan will be activated.

2.  #### Tello Mobile -- SIM/ E-SIM Review

{{< image url="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/13/f5/3113f5ccdf89565e334338e6427495dd.png" >}}

The post premium out of all cheap network providers if you are looking for something which is cheap as well as a blend of premium service tello is a really good option. yet it is not really perfect.

Things to remember before buying a plan

Plan prices are a bit fishy after adding the taxes they all roundup to same amount which is misleading and does't make any sense.

-   unlimited text and talk + 0 MB = 10.5$
-   unlimited text and talk + 500MB = 10.64$
-   unlimited text and talk + 1GB = 10.54$

As you may see the plan with 0MB to 1GB price almost the same, so i highly suggest to buy 1GB plan as it cost the same as No data plan.

I'm personally using Tello mobile and never faced any problem with it. highly recommended.

3.  #### TextNow -- SIM Version / VOIP 0$

{{< image url="https://cdn.freelogovectors.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/textnow-logo-freelogovectors.net_.png" >}}

You wont believe that this is a 0$ per month plan. No really, this is the cheapest plan in the list. All we have to do is to pay for the physical sim and that's it we can make unlimited talk and text to any number for FREE. but there is catch. we cannot use the default phone and SMS app, instead we have to use the propitiatory application make by TextNow to make call and SMS. which works fine without issues so its worth mentioning.

TextNow is the only mobile provider to offer nationwide phone service for free --- always. Download the app to call and text without ever having to pay a phone bill.

For using a physical sim version

we need to buy a physical sim costing around 5$ which is a one time price and thats it no other payment needed. Yet keep in mind that the number needs to be running if not it will be lost or given to a different user.

There no need to have an active internet connection to use the service if we have a physical sim.

For using a VOIP version

if you dont need a physical sim then its fine just install the app , get a number and boom you can have a secondary number

4.  #### Google Voice -- VOIP

{{< image url="https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/google-voice8556.jpg" >}}

The ability to obtain a secondary phone number directly from the app, without the need for a separate data plan, is particularly advantageous. This feature enables users to maintain a separate line for personal or business use without the hassle and cost of acquiring an additional physical SIM card or contract. Moreover, the option to choose a desired number adds a layer of personalization, allowing users to select a number that aligns with their preferences or business branding.

5.  #### TextFree 

I felt TextNow is a lot better than this as it supports web version as well. so i didnt wanted to mention this. Just use TextNow its a lot better compared to TextFree.
